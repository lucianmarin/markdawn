title: "Uniqueness "

Saturday is a peaceful day most of the time. We all want to relax,  recharge our batteries for the next week, switch off the light earlier. I must say day dreaming is associated with this glorious day. But let's be serious, everyone spends it in his/hers own way.
This description brings me closer to the thoughts that spread my mind "are we all unique?". My favorite quote about uniqueness is the following "A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament." by Oscar Wilde.

Yes, we are. We all think different, we all have different visions. You stare at a painting and start thinking, is there someone out there who will buy that unstyled painting? well, again the answer is "yes". I had a few conversations with people debating topics such as being unique (unique refers to "being the only one of its kind", "without an equal or equivalent; unparalleled") and we got to no conclusions. There are people who look the same, let's say twins. In most cases, they wear the same clothes, but you won't see them growing old in the same direction. Anyone has his/hers own temper and genetic seeds. It depends on himself/herself how they develop, how they use what mother nature gave them.

What will happen if all of the people would think the same, let's define it as common? The only answer I have in my mind is "monotony". In this case you can guess what a certain person is going to do in the near future, because you will do almost the same things. I have a certain example in my mind, it refers to companies. Just think what will happen to them if the owners have the same vision, even the employees. Where is the competitiveness? What criteria will be taken into consideration to list companies on the stock market? I am sure we have our own vision, own thoughts, our own way of answering all of the questions above. 

Nowadays, everyone wants to be unique starting from when we are young. You want to be distinguished from other colleagues at school. In this case you try to think how you can be different, so you choose to walk in a certain way, change your temper, or speak, or dress, or even work. During your development as a human being, you try to improve your skills which make you who you want to be, unique.  

I will end my thoughts with a memorable quote by Walt Disney "The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique." Uniqueness can be interpreted from many points of view, I chose just a few.
