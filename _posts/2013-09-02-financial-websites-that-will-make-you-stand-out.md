This generation is more money-wise when it comes to investment and financial markets. When you want to invest, you should take time and make notes of the things you find about a certain company, indicator you are interested in. Where to find the information you need such as archives? Internet.

 I’ll make a top of the best websites where you can find credible-updated news. The business and financial news of the following websites get updated throughout the day so you can find fresh tips and market hints thanks to the range of newsletters and alerts. 

1. **Financial Times** [www.ft.com](http://www.ft.com/home/uk) even if you have to pay (monthly/annual) to get all the information you need, it’s worth spending a few dollars/euros. The Financial Times is one of the world’s leading business news and information organisations.
If you opt for the newspaper, you must know that it publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of constituents.

2. **MarketWatch** [www.marketwatch.com](http://www.marketwatch.com) provides business news, analysis and stock market data for The US mostly. It focuses on economy, investments, markets, personal finance. The website it’s very useful because it has many charts (for example you can see “the sentiment on a specific company/indice”), historical quotes, estimations, overall insights you can’t find on every website. MarketWatch is a part of Dow Jones’ Consumer Media Group, along with “The Wall Street Journal”, “Barron’s”, the WSJ.com and affiliated internet properties.

3. **Bloomberg** [www.bloomberg.com](http://www.bloomberg.com) is all about up-to-date business analysis and financial data. The website has a proper personal finance section where you can find news supported by videos and charts. Bloomberg L.P. is a multinational mass media limited partnership based in New York City.

4. **This is Money** [www.thisismoney.co.uk](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/index.html) covers the whole financial market. Has predictions, charts and news. It’s is based in England and is part of Daily Mail (the second largest selling newspaper in The UK).

5. **Les Echos** [www.lesechos.fr](http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/finance-marches/index.php) If you are from the French side, I would suggest this website which covers a wide range of news worldwide, especially from Europe. The number of charts is quite low, which brings it down on 5th place.

These websites can help the investor make the best decisions as they offer all the information needed so he/she will know if to take part into that company or not!
