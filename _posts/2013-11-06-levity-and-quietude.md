Levity and quietude  
When sullen snows  
Aswirl fly  
And darkened night wakes to drifting morn  
Muddened steps outside the door  
Banks and banks of crusty snow  
Flung aside for here we go  
To venture forth among the down  
And out about around and back  
The vast warmth of a welcome bed  
Brings rest for a tired head  
And I shall wake again next morn  
And start this all over again
