While researching "wakeful rest" I remembered this Hacker koan:

>    In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.

>  "What are you doing?", asked Minsky.

>   "I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-tac-toe", Sussman replied.

>    "Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.

>    "I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play", Sussman said.

>  Minsky then shut his eyes.

>  "Why do you close your eyes?" Sussman asked his teacher.

>  "So that the room will be empty."

>  At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.
