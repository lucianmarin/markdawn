title: "Some thoughts about Twitter"

I registered my first twitter account in 2009. It's not so long since Twitter had been launched in 2006. But in this 4 years i have made several conclusions.

First thing is the content delivery. It's fast and awesome. I stayed in touch with many other people and companies around the world and receive content faster than in any other social network.

Second, the content itself. 140 symbols make sense. If you want to tell about what you feel right now it's good. If you want to describe something like what exactly do you feel, how do you do something or who is wrong in the Internet, in most cases 140 limit is not enough. You might say “So what?! That is main idea of Twitter!” and you'll be right. But wait. I can also write same things on Facebook or VK, there is neither minimum nor maximum symbol limit! I can also write in these social networks limiting myself in 140 symbols. But when i need to write more, i write more. On twitter i can't. When the limit is exceeded I have to push “new tweet“ and “send tweet” buttons again and again. And while i'm writing those tweets they can lost among the other tweets in your twitter feed. All of this is the dealbreaker for me.
