Your favourite match starts, you keep concentrated on TV because bets are involved. You are so tensed because it's possible to lose those money, you even cover your face. The match ends and you win!

  University courses have been a real challenge for me lately. Getting familiarised with specific concepts it's a little difficult, but putting them into practice become a lot more appealing.

  Last month I found a few platforms which help me going on with one of my projects. They are called **"Wall Street Survivor"** and **"MarketWatch Portfolio"**. They are both designed to help normal people find their fascination for investments. I'm currently using "Wall Street Survivor".
They both offer 100.000$ to virtually invest into stocks. You are allowed to buy whatever stock you prefer and you see the changes in real time. The one I use at the moment has free courses and helps you create a basic portfolio.
You can create *"My Watchlist"* which contains the companies you invested in or want to invest. This also gives information such as: total expenses, EBITDA, net income. These are important indicators that show the amount of money the company made last quarter from business activities (for example sales of goods or services). If you want in depth information about the company and the evolution (such as charts, dividend, dividend yield, velocity, analyst ratings) I suggest MarketWatch.

  Investments are not for everyone as **Warren Buffet**, the most successful investor of the 20th century says (*"The first rule is not to lose. The second rule is not to forget the first rule"*. - Warren Buffet). The list of essential characteristics Buffett looks for in an investment is surprisingly short. He wants a business that’s **easy to understand**, with a **consistent operating history**; **good long term prospects**, possibly due to some durable competitive advantages, or “moats”; **a trustworthy, high-quality management team**; and **solid financials**: high margins, high return on equity, and high free cash flow. 

  Go hectic, be unique, do what you like!
