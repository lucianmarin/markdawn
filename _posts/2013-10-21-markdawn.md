So I'm writing this post to test out *Markdawn*, wondering if it's related to Markdown, as there is no information on the website about what exactly it is.

Oh wait - I click the little grey question mark and out pops a quick reference for formatting syntax. Yeah, I think this is Markdown (or something similar). Interesting, I just saw this editor auto close my parenthesis.

Let me try some code:

    def play(lst):
        random.shuffle(lst)
        if sorted(lst) == lst:
            return 'bingo!'

Hmm, that was actually nice because:

* Using the TAB key worked as desired.
* Emacs style shortcuts worked (Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N, etc.).

What I would love is:

* Auto indenting new lines to match previous line.
* Syntax highlighting for multiple languages (specially Python :).

That's it for now but the experiments will continue.
