Sure. Why not?  I've always liked Markdown.  Constraints can be a way to help you focus your energy. When you deny yourself all of the "stylistic" noise that comes from color, font, size and alignment, all that you have left is the content.

# But Is Everything Text?

I started and aborted a UNICODE-based variant of Markdown. While UNICODE provides a slew of symbols that provide many different semantic functions, just doing another text-markup system was going to end up being a repeat of another well-explored pattern.

I think that we're probably missing out on a more fundamental markup syntax, not for text, but for graphs. Graphs appear to be a much more general purpose abstraction than source-text and we would have been in a much more exciting information era had we *not* adopted the hierarchical file-system abstractions that Multics brought to us in 1965. But, more about that later. I'm playing with Markdawn. :)
