title: "Simplicity"

You hear everywhere in the street, on TV, on Websites, the word "simple"! I actually think we do the opposite. When we think of simplyifing a project we work on, a phrase (for example this one) we complicate things without even knowing.

They say simplifying saves time, but I think our brain concentrates on how we can do that and misses the important aspect. We lose time trying to find the essence to focus on and eliminate other uninteresting points, but what if we miss the "essence"? Leonardo da Vinci says "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"(even if his paintings were actually very complicated in composition), "Simplicity is the glory of expression" another quote by Walt Whitman, but the one I consider relevant is the following one "The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity" by Douglas Horton.

Let's say we have 10 tasks for the next day, how can we choose the easy way to manage all of them? the answer "simplify", how can we do that? delete a few lines from one of the reports so we finish in time? We won't become superficial, I hope!  
In fact, the word *simple* is very complex. You can simplify when you get deep into the subject and understand it very well in order to see the main aspects to focus on. 

Simplicity is a very deep word with a powerful meaning!
