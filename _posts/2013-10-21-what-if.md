I found the "[Seven Attitudinal Factors of Mindfulness](http://mindfulness-sydney.com/seven-attitudinal-factors)" once a long time ago. I had trouble grasping the basic ideas, so I researched many different descriptions and tried to boil it down into simple, clear ideas.

Hope you enjoy! I sometimes use these passages to begin a meditation session, or just to help me focus and relax.

### noticing what I'm feeling

what if i

don't judge

don't assume?


i might simply be aware of things

i might notice new things.
 
### focusing on now

what if there are

no goals

no deadlines

no standards?


i might be more by trying less

i might have plenty of time

i might be myself.
 
### being present

what if i

don't deny

don't hold on?


i might be real

i might let go.
