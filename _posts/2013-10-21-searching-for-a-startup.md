Steve Blank describes a startup as a “temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scaleable business model.”

## Background
Two years ago I started a "business" that had no business model. No way to really make money. It was successful enough at getting people to read, but the advertising dollars are paltry for a small niche.

## Searching for a Startup
After a year-long *entrepreneurial nap*, it's time to get back in the game. I'm writing through ideas and soon will start writing about my process of starting a business.

If you're interested in startups and want to start one yourself someday, check it out at [Searching For a Startup](http://iambateman.com).

Over the next several weeks, I’m going to be searching for a concept. During that time, we’ll be discussing (in the comments) a ton of different ideas and eventually use the Business Model Canvas to describe the specific hypotheses that need to be tested to begin the first build-measure-learn loop.

I'm always looking for feedback!
