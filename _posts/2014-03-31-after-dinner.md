after dinner  
in the flicking lull  
of hungered log  
the settling  
the sighs  
all amongst  
the star rise   
murmur murmurings  
cloaks  
from yesteryear  
great tides  
endarkening the thin grass  
tawny sway of waves  
red be me  
the so fast tumbling  
the wet crush  
loosened tongues  
rolling in  
rustling  
foots steps  
with solemnity sit  
lips parted  
moisten  
hear here
