So I read the story that was written on [The Minimalists'](http://theminimalists.com) website. Yes, the 21-day journey into becoming a minimalist.

Have I done any of the things they said to do? A little. Mostly it's been a  slow start and I've been trying to think about how to train my mind when I hear and learn about things, new or old.

I have a lot of clutter in my "home-office." I've been trying to clean it up ever since we moved in around 8 years ago! It's a sad admittance of failure, but I can't make me let go of so many little things that bring up such good memories. Some memories that help me remember my father, grandmother and good times I lived in a far away land.

I can only say that minimalism is a great idea and that the goal it focusses on are the right ones in my opinion, but I have to convince the rest of myself, the subconscious and the hoarder that won't allow me to reach the bare goal of living the moment in my life.
