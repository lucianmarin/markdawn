title: "How Would You Define Work?"

It's one of those cold evenings when you are not in the mood of going out or throw a fancy party, so you choose to think and analyse, even though they are just simple and normal things from our lives. You decide to play a song to set the atmosphere needed and don't feel the loneliness.

I am sure we all thought about the word "work". You ask people and they give you different answers, search it in the dictionary and get to the conclusion that  everyone is connected to this word differently. 

I'll try to give you my opinion using a quote of Henry Matisse "Work cures everything". How is that, you may ask? When you work, you concentrate to do your best, to succeed, sometimes you feel that terrible pressure (mostly when deadlines are involved), lose track of time, of how tired you are. I'll define it as "feeling absorbed". It doesn't matter in what domain you work, the connection is the same. It doesn't matter if you are a painter and you probably define work as a piece of art, or an economist who will definitely think he/she is the company saver, even an IT technician who will use a better app to connect the world one day. Some of us work for money (I found the following quote quite true "Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it." by Henry David Thoreau) some for achieving someone else's goal and the happy people who work to fulfill their dream and stimulate their imagination even more. 

The working experience is getting quite interesting when you are in a relationship and have to do more tasks than usual. There are two kind of partners, those who understand your situation and those who don't. The gentle and rational people are quite rare nowadays; in case you find them, you would better try and keep them. Most of the other side start cheating and end up breaking up. I don't know in which of these two positions you are, but I will always support the person beside me.

When do you know an employee is efficient (definition: effective operation as measured by a comparison of production with cost)? Well, when comes with a smile on his/hers face and work for the benefit of the company, to make his/hers dream come true and gain even more experience in that domain. On the other side, are those who use all sorts of social networks during their working hours, or want to go home earlier and invent all sorts of excuses. There is a place for everyone in this world. The most important thing is to find what you truly like to do, what are your hobbies, what is the activity you prefer the most.

When you work with passion you will always succeed, never forget it!
