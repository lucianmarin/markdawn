I suppose there's a moment when you want things to be different. In a modern, futuristic world people want change. Some might say that you deserve the best, some might claim a few human rights.

Markdawn become so impossible perfect. If I look at the code behind it, everything is so complex and complete. It's like I didn't even write this thing a few months ago.

Now I started working on [a new web application](http://sublevel.net/) powered by Django. Every line of the code that goes in the new web application makes me come back to Markdawn to add a few new features here and there. It makes me wonder what's missing or is it just a marketing issue that I can't get pass through.

How can we fix Markdawn?
