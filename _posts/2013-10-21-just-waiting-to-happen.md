One of these days a SaaS page just like this one will solely be set up to harvest passwords - the vast majority of users use the same user name and password on all sites. Setting up a nice-looking site like this and posting it to HN and Reddit would probably result in around a hundred "hot" user/password combos...

All the more reason to generate random passwords for every site you use.
