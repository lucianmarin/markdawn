Hello! This is my first post on Markdawn. I found it via [Sublevel](https://sublevel.net), which I'm enjoying. Lucian has a great approach. :-)

I'm Web Literacy Lead for the non-profit [Mozilla Foundation](https://mozilla.org/foundation). In that role, I do a lot of thinking how to 'teach the web' to others. Underpinning all of the work we do at [Webmaker](https://webmaker.org) is the [Web Literacy Map](https://webmaker.org/resources), which we call 'the skills and competencies required to read, write and participate on the web'.

The above image is the competency grid of the Web Literacy Map. We're currently working on a v2.0 and, as part of this, we've got a community survey. It would be great if you could take the time to complete it:

If you're interested, you can check out some of the [interesting feedback so far](http://literaci.es/feedback-from-weblitmap-v2-survey) and perhaps even join us for the [community calls](http://literaci.es/weblitmap2-calls) starting on 20th October 2014?
