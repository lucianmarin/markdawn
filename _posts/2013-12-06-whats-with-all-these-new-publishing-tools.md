It's now been a while since this trend started: we now have Medium, Svbtle, and apparently newborn Markdawn. And yet no one seems to show the shadow of a coherent business model.
I understand they all have to go through an empty phase where all that matters is to make people come to the website regularly, but at some point they'll all have to ean a living.

How do you think things will evolve, and what's your opinion on each platform? (am I missing any?)
