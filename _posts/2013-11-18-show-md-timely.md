title: "Show MD: Timely"

Fame and fortune on Hacker News is not exactly working (go figure), so I thought of starting a new trend here on Markdawn. Hopefully Lucian will approve of this addition. Not a big deal really.

"Show MD" like "Show HN"

Don't get confused with the "MD", it's not some doctors thing. 

To kick it off, I want to show you all that new task manager I was working on.

Check it out: [Timely](http://northstarco.github.io/timely/)

Hopefully the audience here will benefit from it.
