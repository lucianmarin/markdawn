I am sure we all have our own definition of soul. We all have our own values and beliefs. Flash makes us doubt, flash makes us change perception about a person.

Soul defines a person entirely, makes a person who he/she is. It's a natural gift, one that you have to polish throughout your life. It's up to you who do you want to be. The definition of souls stands in your eyes (even if they are very sad sometimes) and smile.

Nowadays, people become more and more envious. This world became a lion arena where the most powerful wins. In my opinion, the winners are people with a good heart, who understand why they were created, what is their purpose in this life, people who create value and cherish every moment with another soul ("Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies."- Aristotle), who reflect on their actions. Soul will help us get through very difficult times, will make us learn what is good or bad, will guide each of our steps.

We analyse so many ideas, thoughts we don't know what decision to make. Often, times is involved as well, so there is a lot more pressure. In this circumstances you understand who you are by putting on the first place the difficult but honest possibility, or the easy but unfair one. Put your heart, mind, and soul into even the smallest acts. This is the secret of success.

"Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul."- Democritus.
