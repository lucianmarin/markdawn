title: "Symphony of Heart"

It's one of those evenings when nature wants to surprise us one more time. There is such a strong connection between human's heart and natural manifestations. I don't know how many people felt the connection between the beats of the heart and the sound of the raindrops when they touch a surface. 

Heart is not just an organ, it's so much more. It sends feelings when you like or dislike a certain aspect, it sings when you fall in love, it crys just like rain when you are in pain. Heart is a symphony. Is a symphony of each human being, it can be calm so it plays Chopin, it can be angry, so it plays Stravinsky. It's the most precious part of an individual. Heart can have the same intensity of the raindrops, or snowflakes, or wind, or even waves. But somehow heart is an organ and must be taken care of throughout the years, to keep it going, to keep it ticking, to keep it beating. Learn how to take care of it to enjoy its magic. 

Staying in front of the door for more than 7 hours, waiting for a response, a crucial one, was one of the bravest actions. It was dark, was raining and was so much pain. Heart beated so quickly when a single sound could be heard. Eyes were looking straight at a white object, called door and felt disturbed by a ticking box which told that you are not allowed to enter. Waiting was difficult, even seconds passed so slowly. Millions of scenarios crossed my mind, some were happy and made my face bright up a little bit, but some were dark so wrinkles were visible. Somehow time flies... 

Just imagine a blade of grass, it needs rain and sun to grow (just like humans who encounter good and difficult moments throughout life), it needs time, it needs other blades to keep company and ultimately it dries. Death is the moment when heart stops beating, but the feelings don't fade, they remain with that person. They surround him, they guide him. That is just another beginning!
