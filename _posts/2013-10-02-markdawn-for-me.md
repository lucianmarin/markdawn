I have always been a fan of writing elaborately long drawn emails and articles. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing a lot of your text come alive on a computer screen, and rendered in the same way to everyone who wants to take a look at it. 
First there were the readability services, which propagandized reading long drawn articles. But then, all those were only by editors at news websites, and in the age of social media, we are the creators. Writing long articles is probably too old fashioned in this modern fast paced world. When I have some quiet time all to myself, there is nothing I would rather do than write. 

###On Twitter
Twitter gave us the power to become the 140 character journalists. But that's about it. It was good for sharing links to those long articles I loved reading, or to my short blog posts.

###On Medium
Medium makes people write, and is probably the first service which makes its focus on creating long drawn pieces of text. But currently, follows an invite only system where only existing users can invite others to write. Any service needs competition, and I am glad that markdawn is out.

###On blog posts
There's always something about blogging that made me want to be less elaborate. There is always the compulsion to add images, cross-links or to categorize, review or to make sense. For the mind to be truly free, we must write as if I were writing on a piece of paper. Not typing on a computer screen. 

And that is why, Markdawn is for me.
