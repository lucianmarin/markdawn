autumn in the dusk of the year  
pungent smells brisk winds  
sun dances near the horizon  
migrating dreams a few  
round apples tart and sweet  
delight me in sense and hue  
lovely loving to love  
bask in this brief warmth  
i fade into the night  
the stars beckon with time  
bring me to this end  
whole and longing
