    <p>Markdawn is now multi-author publication powered by <a href="https://github.com/lucianmarin/markdawn/tree/gh-pages">GitHub Pages</a> and Jekyll using <a href="http://lucianmarin.com/spaceman/">Spaceman</a> theme. All the content have been saved in a Git repository. You can find your old articles there.</p>
