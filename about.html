    <p>Markdawn is now multi-author open-source publication powered by <a href="https://github.com/lucianmarin/markdawn/">GitHub Pages</a> and Jekyll using <a href="http://lucianmarin.com/spaceman/">Spaceman</a> theme. All your old content on the previous writing platform have been saved in the Git repository. You can find all the articles there.</p>
